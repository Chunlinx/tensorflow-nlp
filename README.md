# tensorflow-implementations

This repo contains my implementations of some prevailing Neural Network models for NLP with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

Most of these models are trained and tested with real NLP tasks and datasets. And the codes for these tasks are also included in the `src` folder so that you can quickly get started.

You can click into the directory of each model to see detailed corresponding description.
