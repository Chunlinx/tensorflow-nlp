This repo implements the model described in [Improved Semantic
    Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory
    Networks](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00075.pdf), with recurrent
    dropout as described in [Recurrent Dropout without Memory Loss]
    (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05118.pdf)

It is actually a fork and refactor of the 
    [ipynb tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/fold/blob/master/tensorflow_fold/g3doc/sentiment.ipynb) 
    in the official repo. You can refer to that for more details. 
    
    
This code is tested on Python 3.5 and it requires Tensorflow 1.0 and [Tensorflow Fold](https://github.com/tensorflow/fold) to run, which you can install
    with pip:
    ```
        pip install tensorflow
        pip install tensorflow_fold
    ```
